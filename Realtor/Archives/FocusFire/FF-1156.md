[FF-1156: Cash Field stuck in FocusFire once selected](https://moveinc.atlassian.net/browse/FF-1156)
Description: When a CSR selects "Cash" from the financing drop down, it will grey out and the rep is then unable to make any changes to that field.

###### Investigation

We made the change to function components as part of [# LPO-46: EditLeadDisposition Functional Component #17894](https://github.com/Opcity/opcity/pull/17894) on 2022-01-10 and I looked back as far as the last commit on 2021-09-08 at [5b39603ef55dae4ac9f98187cd0863c1c30d27a9](https://github.com/Opcity/opcity/commit/5b39603ef55dae4ac9f98187cd0863c1c30d27a9) they both had the same disabling behavior. I figured looking a year into the past was good enough.

Your comment on the Jira:
> I think this is expected behavior. The CSR would have to clear the LENDER CONTACT field to be able to update Cash.

is correct.

I thought I'd give you a chance to review and wordsmith this before I plopped it into the Jira. :smile: :thread:
