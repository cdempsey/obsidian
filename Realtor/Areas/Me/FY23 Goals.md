2. Improve the FocusFire, Lender, and Lead Pool Team Code Quality
	-   **Specific**: Ensure we gain stronger code quality at the lowest effort will set the tone for the rest of the engineering.
	-   **Measurable**: On a monthly cadence, check and report on the testing coverage and automated checks added ( should both rise month over month ), and reverts ( which should drop month over month ).
	-   **Achievable**: In previous positions I've increased test by 10x in a year and implemented numerous automated quality checks to remove the team from manually having to spend time on it.
