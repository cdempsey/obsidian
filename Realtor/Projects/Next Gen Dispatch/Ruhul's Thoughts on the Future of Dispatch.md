> FYI I talked with [[Daniel]] yesterday during our 1:1 about some dispatch related thoughts I have. I know I've mentioned some or all in passing with you, but wanted to "write" it down here.
> 
> -   We talk about "speed to lead" and "speed to assignment" a lot. With the world changing on how we route leads, I was thinking we might what to reframe those to something like: **"speed to lead", "speed to dispatch", and "speed to dispatch resolution"** (not the best words but general idea).
> -   "Dispatch" tends to be seen as "how we contact agents". **I've been viewing it as <mark>"where do we send the lead"</mark> instead**.
> -   **"Dispatch" can handle different schemes, e.g. RCC, MVIP, NGL, VU. And each scheme can have different strategies, e.g. traditional, broadcast, API**.
> -   **Clean/clear API/data boundaries to help enforce and measure the above things.**
>
> These are my opinions so I'm not trying to dictate anything to you or the team.It seemed to resonate with [[Daniel]], and hopefully with you as well. Please let me know if you disagree and do challenge anything/everything as you see fit.
