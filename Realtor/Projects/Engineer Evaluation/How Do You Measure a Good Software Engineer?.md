[How Do You Measure a Good Software Engineer?](https://surfingthe.cloud/are-you-a-good-engineer/)

> [!quote]
> Quality comes through the forge of [experiential learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiential_learning), or basically learning by experience (on-the-job).

> [!quote]
> To leverage experiential learning, we must embrace four elements:
>
> -   _be active_ - you engage and are part of the experience
> -   _introspect_ - you take time to reflect on the experience
> -   _analyze_ - you use analytical skills to conceptualize the experience
> -   _leverage_ - you use decision making and problem-solving skills to leverage the new ideas

> This misuse of titles is an anti-pattern, yet there is a continual push to associate "rank," or some form of experience, as being equivalent to capability, and then use a measuring stick of a job title to denote authority.

> [!quote]
> Somebody with 15 years of experience at one location may be amazing, but they could also be stuck in a rut and haven't been challenged as much as they would have been if they had moved on.

> [!quote]
> Knowing we are faced with a hard challenge, focus instead on Aptitude and Expertise.

> [!quote]
> Aptitude is our ability to self-motivate, decompose a deliverable into tasks to produce a result, and to understand the idiomatic way of our engineering discipline.

> [!quote]
> Expertise is different from Experience; it is a way to determine how much an engineer may have been challenged beyond their usual routine — or how much they may have been exposed to experiential learning.
