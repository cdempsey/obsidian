		- In select markets across the country, we are testing different referral options for ReadyConnect Concierge℠ brokers and agents, based on the demand for different types of leads.
		- Our current referral rates for most of the leads in these markets will remain unchanged. A small percentage of consumer leads in these markets will be offered at variable rates, as either Platinum or Promotional referrals.
		- **Platinum Referrals** reflect a variety of factors like higher home values, pre-qualified or cash buyers, urgent close timelines, and more. Leads selected for Platinum Referrals will be offered for either 30-35 percent (our current referral fee) or 40 percent, due upon closing. Agents can determine the value of these leads in the context of their own business activity and choose to accept or decline them.
			- Platinum referrals are in highest demand by agents across our ReadyConnect Concierge℠ network, so these referrals come with higher performance fees.
		- **Promotional Referrals** are leads from consumers that were initially not connected with an agent and/or whose budget falls between 70 and 130 percent of the local market median home price. Leads selected for Promotional Referrals will be offered for anywhere from 30-35 percent (our current referral fee) to either a 25, 20 or 15 percent referral fee, due upon closing. Agents can determine if these referrals work in the context of their business and choose to accept or decline them.
			- The fees are reduced for promotional referrals; their value is in the subsequent follow-up and opportunity to cultivate additional client relationships.

		- **The annualized projection of $6MM (~$900k FY23 in-period) would be diminished if lead volume to ReadyConnect Concierge is artificially reduced through various initiatives that are being considered (i.e. flipping markets back to Choice, moving 3rd party leads to Connections+, routing leads to MVIP from RCC, etc)**
			- Where are we getting this data?
			- Do we have any ideas of how much of a reduction we'd see?
